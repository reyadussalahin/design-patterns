Design Patterns is, without any doubt one of the most hard to grasp topics in SE. One of the reason is, even after understanding patterns theoretically, it's very hard to track down it's usecase in real life applications. Design Patterns are often misunderstood/misused, just to create more problems than solving them. Our attempt here is to provide very good, yet easy to understand real life applications of design patterns, so that one may grasp the concept properly as well as understand it's practical usage with merits and demerits.
